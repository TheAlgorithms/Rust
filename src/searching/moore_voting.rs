/*

    Moore's voting algorithm finds out the strictly majority-occurring element
    without using extra space
    and O(n) + O(n) time complexity

    It is built on the intuition that a strictly major element will always have a net occurrence as 1.
    Say, array given: 9 1 8 1 1
    Here, the algorithm will work as:

    (for finding element present >(n/2) times)
    (assumed: all elements are >0)

    Initialisation: ele=0, cnt=0
    Loop beings.

    loop 1: arr[0]=9
    ele = 9
    cnt=1 (since cnt = 0, cnt increments to 1 and ele = 9)

    loop 2: arr[1]=1
    ele = 9
    cnt= 0 (since in this turn of the loop, the array[i] != ele, cnt decrements by 1)

    loop 3: arr[2]=8
    ele = 8
    cnt=1 (since cnt = 0, cnt increments to 1 and ele = 8)

    loop 4: arr[3]=1
    ele = 8
    cnt= 0 (since in this turn of the loop, the array[i] != ele, cnt decrements by 1)

    loop 5: arr[4]=1
    ele = 9
    cnt=1 (since cnt = 0, cnt increments to 1 and ele = 1)

    Now, this ele should be the majority element if there's any
    To check, a quick O(n) loop is run to check if the count of ele is >(n/2), n being the length of the array

    -1 is returned when no such element is found.
