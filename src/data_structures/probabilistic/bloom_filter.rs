/// Let's imagine we have a huge number of elements to store (like un unbounded data stream) a Set storing every element will most likely take up too much space, at some point.
/// As other probabilistic data structures like Count-min Sketch, the goal of a Bloom Filter is to trade off exactitude for constant space.
/// We won't have a strictly exact result of whether the value belongs to the set, but we'll use constant space instead

/// Let's start with the basic idea behind the implementation
/// Let's start by trying to make a `HashSet` with constant space:
/// Instead of storing every element and grow the set infinitely, let's use a vector with constant capacity `CAPACITY`
/// Each element of this vector will be a boolean.
/// When a new element is inserted, we hash its value and set the index at index `hash(item) % CAPACITY` to `true`
/// When looking for an item, we hash its value and retrieve the boolean at index `hash(item) % CAPACITY`
/// If it's `false` it's absolutely sure the item isn't present
/// If it's `true` the item may be present, or maybe another one produces the same hash

/// Imagine a `CAPACITY` of `6`. The initial value for our mask is `000000`.

///
/// As we did with count-min-sketch, we could use multiple hash function.
/// When inserting a value, we compute its hash with every hash function (`hash_i`) and perform the same operation as above (the OR with `fingerprint`)
/// Then when looking for a value, if **ANY** of the tests (`hash` then `AND`) returns 0 then this means the value is missing from the set, otherwise it would have returned 1
/// If it returns `1`, it **may** be that the item is present, but could also be a collision
/// This is what a Bloom Filter is about: returning `false` means the value is necessarily absent, and returning true means it may be present
